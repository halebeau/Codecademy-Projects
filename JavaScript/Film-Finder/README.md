## Description

This film finder app comes from a guided project on Codecademy to practice making requests with the fetch API.

Before I expanded on this project, the app's functionality was limited to searching your next watch by genre, displaying the movie poster, title, and synopsis, and clicking 👍🏻'like' or 👎🏻'dislike' buttons to show another random movie in this genre.

## API

This project uses the [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Please use your own key or register for one by creating an account on TMDB and following the instructions in the link above.

## Added features

I took the initiative to add the following features:
- Option to search movies by actor, combined with the movie genre
- Display the movie rating and cast
- Randomize results from a random page of results instead of just the first page
- Functionality to store the liked and disliked movies (with a link to their IMDb page) in the local storage as well as in a sidebar
- Functionality to clear all liked/disliked movies or to delete them individually from both the page and local storage
- Various improvements in the layout, positioning, and general styles
- Responsiveness
